# Requirements
1. Use Playwright automation framework and Typescript programming language
2. Identify and prioritize the key test scenarios to ensure proper coverage of the
website's functionality.
3. Design and implement automated tests for at least three test scenarios, including
positive and negative test cases.
4. Demonstrate proper usage of test frameworks, page object model, data-driven
testing, and assertions in your test implementation.
5. Include proper setup and teardown procedures, such as setting up test data and
cleaning up after each test.
6. Ensure your tests are well-structured, maintainable, and easy to understand.

# Deliverables
1. Provide a clear and concise document outlining the test scenarios you have
identified and their priority.
2. Include the code implementation of the automated tests, along with any necessary
configuration or setup instructions.
3. If applicable, provide any additional documentation or instructions on how to
execute the tests.
